FOR THE MOMENT COPIED FROM THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION! The appearance of activity recognition algorithms in current smartphones like iPhone and Android helps programmers to build adaptive apps for instance based on their activity status' (walking, running, biking ...). The project aims at extracting alternative high-level context features like taking a turn, entering a room (magnetometer, pressure changers, temperature changes), using steps or elevators etc. to further enhance adaptive systems. Based on this capability and information future context-aware systems could become even more powerful.
